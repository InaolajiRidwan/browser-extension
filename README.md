## 👋 Hi there!

Thanks for checking out my implementation of the **Browser Extensions Manager UI** challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). This project gave me a great opportunity to improve my frontend skills using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

I built this project based on the provided design to closely match the intended UI. The core functionalities I implemented include:

* Toggling extensions between active and inactive states
* Filtering extensions based on their state
* Removing extensions from the list
* Choosing between different color themes
* Ensuring responsive layout across screen sizes
* Adding hover and focus states for all interactive elements

The data powering the extension list comes from a array of `DATA` file, which I used to dynamically render content.

## 📁 Project Structure

* The designs provided (mobile and desktop) were used as the base reference and are located in the `/design` folder.
* All assets (images and fonts) are found in the `/assets` folder.
* I referred to the `style-guide.md` for the project's color palette and font styles.

The design files were in JPG format, so I used my best judgment when it came to sizing, spacing, and font scaling.

## 🛠️ Development Approach

Here’s a quick overview of how I approached the project:

1. Planned the structure and layout based on the design files.
2. Wrote semantic HTML to structure the content.
3. Added base styles for typography and layout.
4. Built out each section of the UI from top to bottom.
5. Implemented JavaScript functionality for interactivity and dynamic rendering.
6. Ensured the layout was responsive and accessible.
7. Added finishing touches like theme switching and state feedback on interaction.
